To follow up on the work on [English word counts](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-zhamadeh/blob/master/report.md), I computed the letter composition of each word, i.e. the letter frequencies, and plotted the frequency of each letter in their respective order in the alphabet. 

The most frequent letters are: E, A, I, O and oddly enough R

Here is a bar graph of this data.
