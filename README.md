Homework Assignment #9 : make-activity
=============

For this assignment, we will work with make files and their ability to create pipelines that interconnect multiple R scripts. This repository was seeded with the following base [pipeline](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity) and I made the following additions:

* Created a new R script
	* Takes in `word.txt` file
	* Creating table of letter frequency for every word in file
	* Exporting this data as `letter_count.tsv` 
		
* Updated the Makefile
	* Use the new .tsv file to create a bar plot of each letter frequency
	
* Created [new]() report file 
	* Available as [html]()
	* Available as [md]()
